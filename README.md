# Covihelp
This is a project executed as a group for college.
Our project is titled "Covihelp", which is a mini covid care center.
It consists of a non contact thermometer, an automatic sanitiser dispenser, and an oximeter.
This prototype is extremely useful, especially during the pandemic where non contact accessibility to day to day activities is necessary.
